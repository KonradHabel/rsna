            gamma: Power factor for dampening weight (focal strength).
            ignore_index: If not None, targets may contain values to be ignored.
                Target values equal to ignore_index will be ignored from loss computation.

            reduced_threshold: Switch to reduced focal loss. Note, when using this mode you
